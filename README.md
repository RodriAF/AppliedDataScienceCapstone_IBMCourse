# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Course

This notebooks are part of a Course from IBM called Applied Data Science Capstone. During the different parts of the course, different tasks were made in the different notebooks and uploaded to the repository. These parts were:

## Week 1 
In this first part the course gave a project scenario and overview. By using an API and Web Scrapping, data was collected and then some data wrangling was made.

### Learnings: 
- Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub
- Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Use your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

## Week 2
This part was about doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by two methodologies. The fisrt one was making SQL queries so an overview can be taken from the data. The other, using pandas and Matplotlib to make some data visualization.

### Learnings:
- Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas data frame
- Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame
- Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data
- Use your data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.

## Week 3
In this module, a dashboard was built to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. Then, it was built an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

### Learnings:
- Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library
- Calculate distances on an interactive map by writing Python code using the Folium library
- Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library
- Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
- Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

## Week 4
Finally, machine learning was used to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. The methodology based on spliting data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then finding the method that performs best using test data.

### Learnings:
- Split the data into training testing data.
- Train different classification models.
- Hyperparameter grid search.
- Use your machine learning skills to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently.

## Week 5
A final week was included to present the data-driven insights. Here, all of activities were compiled into one place and delivered data-driven insights to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully.

### Learnings:
- Learn how to structure and build your data-findings report.
- Submit your final report for peer review.
- Review the work submitted by your peers.
